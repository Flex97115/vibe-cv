# Vibe CV

A modern, multi-language CV website built entirely with AI assistance - no manual code editing involved.

## Project Purpose

This project serves as an experiment to test the current state of AI-powered development tools. The entire codebase is generated by AI, demonstrating the capabilities and limitations of modern AI coding assistants.

### Goals

1. **Test AI Vibe Coding**: Evaluate the progress and effectiveness of AI in full-stack development
2. **Automated CV Management**: Maintain an online CV that updates dynamically, eliminating the need to recreate CVs in Canva for each professional update

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 5.16.0
- **Visualization**: D3.js (for interactive skills graph)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD
- **Languages**: Multi-language support (French/English)

## AI Experiments

### #1 - Gemini Pro 3 (Google DeepMind)
**Date**: November 22, 2025  
**IDE**: Antigravity  
**What was built**: Complete project from scratch including:
- Multi-language CV website (FR/EN) with Astro framework
- Interactive D3.js skills graph with filtering, zoom controls, and category highlighting
- Responsive design with print-optimized styling
- CV-to-graph navigation (clickable skills)
- GitHub Pages deployment with CI/CD workflow

**Experience Notes**:
- Generally smooth and productive development experience
- **Model Performance**: The difference between low and high thinking modes is quite noticeable - the low mode tends to make more frequent mistakes
- **Prompt Complexity**: Combining multiple tasks in a single prompt tends to confuse the AI, regardless of whether it's running in low or high mode
- **Recommendation**: Keep prompts focused on single, clear objectives for best results

## Running the Project

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at:
- French: `http://localhost:4323/fr`
- English: `http://localhost:4323/en`

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Deployment

The project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. To deploy a new version:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy the site.
